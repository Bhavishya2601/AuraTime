    DB_USER = your_db_user
    DB_HOST = your_db_host
    DB_PASSWORD = your_db_password
    DB_DATABASE = your_db_name
    DB_PORT = your_db_port
    SALT_ROUNDS = 10
    EMAIL_USER = your_email_user
    EMAIL_PASS = your_email_pass
    PORT = 3000
    NODE_ENV = development
    SESSION_SECRET = your_session_secret
    JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = your_google_client_id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = your_google_client_secret
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = your_github_client_id
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = your_github_client_secret
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID = your_discord_client_id
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET = your_discord_client_secret
   ```

4. **Start Backend**:
